Our project aims on creating an data ranking API and corresponding website which provides some convinience feature to both programers and player. For programers, they don't have to start from zore to setup the ranking system for the app/game. And the data will be submitted to the server which means it is a great way for developers to learn their customers usage and perference. For users, they don't need to worried about backup the app/game record. The achievenments and record they have will be synchronized among all devices where they use the apps. What's more, they can even know other user/players progress in the app/games.

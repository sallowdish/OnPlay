#About us
*    We a group of student from Simon Fraser University and dedicate ourselves to make people's life different with the technology and knowledge we have.
*    We are working as a team of 5 which called *Cryptonite"

# How to Start
  - Reposity: https://csil-git1.cs.surrey.sfu.ca/groups/group3-cryptonite
  - Local File Location: mx3:/home/share/final_project
  - Using ```$ git clone```to make a copy from repo to your own PC and modify the <code>settings.py</code> and <code>wsgi.py</code> to meet your local developing environment.
  - Run <code>$.manage.py runserver</code> to start the project locally
 
# Tips
  - Start a new branch before making any changes. 
    - [Create a new branch with git and manage branches.](https://github.com/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/wiki/Create-a-new-branch-with-git-and-manage-branches) You may will find this article is helpful.
  - You dont have to restart local server everytime you make some changes. Many changes will be reload automatically.
  - ```$ git merge ``` will make branch-based working very handly. But <b>DO NOT</b> ```PUSH/MERGE``` to master branch until you are sure your version really works.
  - If you add any static file like ```.js .css .jpg``` and etc. , you have to run ```$ ./manage.py collectstatic``` in order to make them ready in deployment evironment.
